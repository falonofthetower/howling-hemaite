    <p>Imagine the back of a semi-truck trailer.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine that a car could fit under there. There are bars, called underride guards, at the back of the truck to stop cars from riding under the truck.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The underride guards don't always stop cars from going under the truck.</li>
      <li>Even at low speeds cars can end up under there!</li>
      <li><strong>Death</strong> of family members is a common result to such crashes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In 2013, our family found that out the hard way. I was traveling with my 3 youngest children when we were struck from behind by a semi-truck. It spun us around and hit us a second time pushing our car under the truck in front of us.</p>

    <p>AnnaLeah (17) and Mary (13) were in the backseat when the rear of the car was pushed under the truck. Both of them died. AnnaLeah wanted to be a writer and Mary wanted to be famous, neither of them got to see their dreams come true.</p>

    <h1>Lives CAN BE Saved!</h1>
    <p>Last year our family was successful in collecting and delivering more than 11,000 signatures in a petition to the Department of Transportation to make changes. Progress is being made toward stricter laws, but the industry needs better options.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Research must be done to offer the trucking industry affordable technologies that protect our families on the road.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Our family started <strong>AnnaLeah and Mary for Truck Safety</strong>, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, to raise funds for truck safety research. We are starting with underride guards because if the underride guard on the truck in front of us had been strong enough to prevent our car from going under it, AnnaLeah and Mary would be here today.</p>
    <p>We are hoping to raise $225,000 to fund underride research and traffic safety projects outlined <a href="http://annaleahmary.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ALMFTS-Traffic-Safety-Ombudsman-Project-Proposal.pdf">here</a>.</p>
